# VerbNurbsSharp
This repository is inspired by the library **Verb** --> [https://github.com/pboyer/verb](https://github.com/pboyer/verb). 
The initial library uses Haxe to build for different languages including C# with some limitation and bugs. This repository is a porting of the library in native C# and is based on NET5 framework.
Still in the very early stages but I am planning to include few examples, including a ConsoleApp and a SPA based on Blazor WebAssembly.
